## Reflection
### YouTube video

-- We created an online learning experience for people to recognize the sounds of five different orchestral instruments. 

-- Learners would first listen to the sound by clicking on the pictures of the instruments. They can get a deeper understanding of the instruments by reading the descriptions on the right side. 

-- Then, they are given a quiz to test their understanding. After clicking on the audio button, learners could choose from the options and be notified whether the answer is correct or not by an alert. The next question only appears when the previous answer is answered correctly. 

-- After the quiz, there is a reflection component and an extension part for learning more instruments by watching a video.

-- Lastly, learners could save their progress and login for continuous learning in the future. 
We hope you enjoyed our design and have fun with the listening quiz!
